## About The Project

`Jihub` is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline the process of importing Jira issues into GitHub based on specific search queries. With `Jihub`, you can seamlessly convert Jira issues into GitHub Issues, ensuring a smooth transition and preserving vital information such as labels, fix versions, and attachments.

Additionally, `Jihub` offers an optional feature to export Jira attachments directly to a designated GitHub repository, further enhancing collaboration and consolidating project resources.

For detailed instructions on how to utilize `Jihub` effectively, please refer to the [Usage](#usage) section. Experience the convenience and efficiency of effortlessly migrating your Jira issues to GitHub with `Jihub`.

## Getting Started

To start using `Jihub`, please follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before executing `Jihub`, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication.
- Write access to the github repository you want to import the issues to
- Valid login credentials for a publicly accessible Jira instance.
- OPTIONAL: If you want to export the jira attachments you need write access to the repository you want to import the attachments to.

### Setup

To setup `Jihub`, just follow these steps:

1. Download the release package of your choice.
2. Within the package, locate the specific zip file for your operating system. For example, if you're using macOS, select `jihub-osx64.zip`.
3. Alternatively, you can download the latest build artifact from the [Actions](https://github.com/Phil91/jihub/actions) section. On the left side, select the Build action and download the artifact that matches your operating system.
4. Unzip jihub and navigate into the unziped folder.
5. Open the appsettings.json with an editor of your choice and fill the following fields

| Configuration      | Key                  | Value          |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Jira               | JiraInstanceUrl      | The url of your jira instance, e.g. https://example-jira.com/                |
|                    | JiraUser             | Your jira username                |
|                    | JiraPassword         | Your jira password               |
| GitHub             | Token                | Your generated GitHub PAT               |
| Parsers:Jira       | EmailMappings        | Mapping between JiraEmail and Github Name, should be in the following format: { "JiraMail": "test.mail.com", "GithubName": "Phil91" }               |


By following these steps, you'll be able to use `Jihub` for importing Jira issues to GitHub.

## Usage

### Create you Jira search query

In your Jira Instance, navigate to `/issues`, for example: https://your-jira-instance.com/issues.
You can filter for the issues of your needs. After your search result is as wanted, click the Advanced Link right next to the serach button to be able to see your jql query. Copy the query and URL encode it (there are plenty of sites doing it on the fly online).

### Execute Jihub

Once you completed the setup open a terminal and navigate to your jihub folder. To run the import simply run:

```shell
dotnet jihub.Worker.dll
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Export to various providers
- [ ] Make configuration easier
- [ ] Enhance Logging
- [ ] Make fields to export to github issues configurable

See the [open issues](https://github.com/phil91/jihub/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Known Limitations

Currently the limit of results taken from the searchQuery is limited to 1000. This will be changed in the future.
Due to GitHub Api limitations the import of the issues to GitHub will pause for 20 seconds after 10 created issues before continuing with the next 10.
